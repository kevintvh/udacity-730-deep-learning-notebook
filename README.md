## Introduction
Exercises and notes I took from Udacity's [Deep Learning course by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730).
Udacity's [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) might be a great pre-requisite, but I didn't get to start from there.

I have no machine learning nor deep learning background. I have limited to no prior knowledge of Python, Numpy, Scikit-Learn.

I'll be keeping this notebook up to date with my progress through the Udacity course.

## Setup
1. Install [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). So that packages I install don't go into the system paths that may conflict with other packages and/or other projects.
1. Checkout this repository: `git clone https://github.com/saturnism/udacity-730-deep-learning-notebook.git`
1. Switch into the directory: `cd ...`
1. Create a new `virtualenv` environment: `virtualenv .`
1. Activate the new environment: `source bin/activqte`. Once activated, every new Python package I install will be installed in the `virtualenv` environment.
1. Install all the dependencies: `pip install -f requirements.txt`
1. Start Jupyter notebook: `jupyter`
1. Browse to Jupyter notebook at `http://localhost:8080`
